On-line discussion platform

The on-line discussion platform, or on-line platform short, is computer software and the necessary underlying blockchain infrastructure that allows secure exchange of messages and the realization of cheap, fast and reliable on-line referendums between members of the DAO. It also provides the visualization of live video streams of video-conferences and debates and serves as a repository for data necessary to the study of the proposals put forward by DAO members.

I.All the information and tools that are considered important to the functioning of the NERV DAO are to be readily available for consultation with real-time data whenever possible on the on-line platform.

II.The on-line platform must deploy the most advanced technologies for identity management and secured communications. This includes cryptographic algorithms such as PKI, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Homomorphic Encryption, blockchain, etc., whenever necessary.
