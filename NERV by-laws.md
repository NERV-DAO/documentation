Mission
</p>

NERV is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) committed to building a free, just, supportive, economic and ecologically sustainable society. We hope to achieve this end by developing software tools that promote a more direct democracy by making use of remote e-voting and supporting organizations that want to implement them.
