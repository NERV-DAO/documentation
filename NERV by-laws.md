## General provisions

<p align="center">
<b>( article 1 )</b><br>
Mission
</p>

NERV is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) committed to developing and implementing software tools that promote democracy, call it liquid or digital. These tools make use of remote e-voting and strong identity management in order to be able to achieve on-line consensus. Our action takes place all over the world from developed countries to installed dictatorships; we are here to help humanity achieve its full potential by combating concentration of power and its abuse.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 2 )</b><br>
Name, acronym and symbol
</p>

This DAO is named Network Emergency Network Vollunteers, or NERV short, inspired by a popular anime series. Colors are black and red and as a symbol we have a lock and a key in representation of our strong values regarding cybersecurity.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 3 )</b><br>
Recognition of the Model Law for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) by the Coalition of Automated Legal Applications
</p>

Considering that at the moment of publication, there is a legal vacuum as regards to how DAOs should be framed in the legal context, worldwide, NERV endorses the adoption of the Model Law for DAOs<sup>[1](https://www.lextechinstitute.ch/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DAO-Model-Law.pdf)</sup> written by the COALA organization.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4 )</b><br>
On-line discussion platform
</p>

The on-line discussion platform, or on-line platform short, is computer software and the necessary underlying blockchain infrastructure that allows secure exchange of messages and the realization of cheap, fast and reliable on-line referendums between members of the DAO. It also provides the visualization of live video streams of video-conferences and debates and serves as a repository for data necessary to the study of the proposals put forward by DAO members.

I. All the information and tools that are considered important to the functioning of the NERV DAO are to be readily available for consultation with real-time data whenever possible on the on-line platform.

II. The on-line platform must deploy the most advanced technologies for identity management and secured communications. This includes cryptographic algorithms such as PKI, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Homomorphic Encryption, blockchain, etc., whenever necessary.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4-b )</b><br>
Functionalities
</p>

Through the on-line platform the DAO members are able to:

I. Watch live streams of any debates and video-conferences that may take place during the DAO activities as well as provide access to previous debates at any time and at all levels of the organisation. This functionality can be paired with existing decentralized networks such as IPFS, Odysee or Skynet as examples.

II. DAO members can chat on-line, publish content and rate each others publications. This can be done publicly or in private groups.

III. Members may publish proposals and vote on-line remotely from their own computer in any location. The voting procedure as well as the final tally must be verifiable by the voter while guaranteeing privacy. This is accomplished through cryptography.<sup>[2](https://github.com/partidodigitalpt/documentation/blob/main/Remote%20e-voting%20overview.md)</sup>

IV. Members are able to delegate to other members the ability to vote on a specific proposal or on a category of proposals and retract the delegation at any time. Delegation is transitive unless stated otherwise.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 4-c )</b><br>
Discussion forum
</p>

The on-line platform has a specific view; an on-line bulletin board, also known as a forum, to be used for written discourse where:

I. Functionalities mentioned in the previous article 4-b I to IV can be linked to and accessed. Each proposal is automatically assigned a topic.

II. Topics are categorized according to different areas of interest.

III. Moderation is user-centric meaning no special roles are assigned to any user.

<p align="center">
<b>( article 5 )</b><br>
Registration
</p>

The enrolment in the DAO is an individual choice and requires the payment of an annual symbolic fee in cryptocurrency, a passphrase given by one of NERV's ambassadors and other necessary documentation following the registration procedure on the on-line platform which may vary by jurisdiction. Raw biometric data is never to be kept in any database.

I. Adherence to or withdrawal from the DAO is made exclusively through the on-line platform. Registries are published and managed in a decentralized database (blockchain).

I. Not partaking in DAO's activities by voting directly or by delegating the right to vote for a period longer than 180 days.

II. By not respecting the deadlines and tasks that were entrusted by the DAO and accepted by the member, the membership may be revoked temporarily for a period of up to 1 year.
