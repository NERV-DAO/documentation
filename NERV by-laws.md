Mission
</p>

NERV is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) committed to building a free, just, supportive, economic and ecologically sustainable society. We hope to achieve this end by developing software tools that promote a more direct democracy, call it liquid or digital. These tools make use of remote e-voting to achieve on-line consensus.
